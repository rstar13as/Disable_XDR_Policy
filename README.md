# Carbon Black Cloud - XDR Policy

Carbon Black Cloud XDR feature enables network telemety within the same agent, it also does add signaificat amount of telemtnry as you would expect as you can replace a internal IPS/IDS. As such you maybe need to disable it before enabling it, as it is enabled by default. These scripts help you disable XDR policy. You can then ask your Sales rep to turn XDR on afterwards.
